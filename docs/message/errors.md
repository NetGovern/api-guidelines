The [`application/problem+json`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807)(Problem Detail) MUST be used to communicate details about an error.

Problem Detail is intended for use with the HTTP status codes 4xx and 5xx.

The RFC encourages problem types to be URI references pointing to the human-readable documentation, but we decided to follow [Zalando approach](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#176). Thus, our problem types are not meant to be resolved and a valid format is: `/problems/unknown-location`.

Example schema:

```yaml
Problem:
  title: Problem
  type: object
  properties:
    type:
      type: string
      description: Problem identifier defined as relative URI reference.
    title:
      type: string
      description: 'A short, summary of the problem type. Written in english and readable for engineers (usually not suited for non technical stakeholders and not localized)'
    detail:
      type: string
      description: A human readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the problem.
    status:
      type: integer
      description: The HTTP status code generated by the origin server for this occurrence of the problem.
      format: int32
      example: 503
      minimum: 100
      maximum: 600
      exclusiveMaximum: true
    instance:
      type: string
      description: An absolute URI that identifies the specific occurrence of the problem.
      format: uri
  required:
    - title
    - detail
    - status
    - type
```

Bulk error handling [is discussed here](patterns/bulk.md).
